Steps to run the code:

1. Install pip and curl (Maybe you have to update via apt).
2. Activate a venv (If you want).
2. Install all requirements via pip -r.
3. Run `python manage.py runserver 8888` from root folder.
4. Go to data folder and run the test script.

Think twice if you are a Windows user, it's an odissey :)
